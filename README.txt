Calapp is a cross-platform mobile application using ionic-angular for the front-end and php for the back-end. This application is meant to improve the quality of life of the staff of the general sports/social club : l’Amicale Laïque de Saint Brieuc (Saint Brieuc laic association) by making them able to schedule events and also to notify specific member that has been invited to the events. This application will be available in the google store first off when it will be ready. Also, since it’s cross platform, it would be obvious to make it available on apple store. Calapp is a long term project so since there is for the moment too much restriction to develop on iOS, it will come later after the project will be considered finished. 
To describe the application more in details, first off, you will be directed to a menu which will ask what kind of user you are. Either you are a member or you are an admin. This menu is temporary and is subject to change due to the fact that it is not well designed in my opinion, but for the development, it made it very easy for me. Now, if you have chosen to be a member, you will be directed to the main page of the app, but due to the fact that a member has to be notified, there will be an authentication menu before you actually enter into the main page. In this main page, you will see the events putted recently by the administrators directly on the app. There is also an option menu that will make you able to reconnect to the app. If you choose now to be an admin, things will change a little. You will see on the top left corner of the screen a button which will allow you to add events. It will ask you which activity you want the event to be linked to. To put it simple, Saint Brieuc laic association has multiple activities and in every activities there is specific members. On the app, every members are listed depending on the activity you choose, this is why it is a step to absolutely not skip. Then you’ll have to choose a title, a date, the localization of the event and the time where the event will start and end. When you validate the event, it will send you to a page which will list every member of the activity you have chosen. When you have chosen every members you wanted, your event is added. Normally it would also send a notification to the specified members, but since it is a work-in-progress app, for now, it’s a simple CRUD that will make you able to add, delete and update an event. It will have more features over time. Thank you for reading !
